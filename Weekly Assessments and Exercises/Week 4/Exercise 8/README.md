# Push Button Counter

Four switches (A,B,C,and D) are connected to Arduino Uno.The microcontroller needs to keep track of how many times each button has been pressed. Whenever any button has been pressed, the microcontroller needs to send out the information (of how many times each button has been pressed) through the serial port.
