# ADC Reading Auto Trigger Mode

The program will continuously prints out the analog value of PC3 in continuously running mode (Auto-Trigger)

**Auto Trigger Mode**
1. Auto-triggered enabled(ADATE = 1)
1. Trigger source can be selected
1. Trigger source(ADTS) == 000 (default) (the most common trigger source_
1. When ADTS == 000, As soon as one conversion completed, another conversion automatically gets carried out.
